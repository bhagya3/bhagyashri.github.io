            <p class="intro-position">What: A mixed reality experience center that combines VR and 4D entertainment technologies to provide a gamified experience to facilitate experiential climate education.

Why: Climate education is considered to be a boring topic by many who do not value science as they grow up. It’s time to make climate education fun!

Major learning point: Designing for VR is harder/easier than you think depending on how you look at it.

Highlight: NASA Space Apps Challenge Seattle Hackathon winner for Most Inspirational Hack.

                Product of a hackathon, Future Suture is the brainchild of Team Stardust Explorers (comprised of Proshonjit Mitra, Prithvi Shetty, Varun Panicker, Bhagyashri Nivdunge, and Pratik Mulchandani). This team had a good mix of Data Scientists, Developers, and a UX Designer, and keeping that context in mind, our team chose to accept the GLOBE-ally challenge of the NASA Space Apps Challenge competition. In this challenge, our goal was to effectively communicate insights using NASA data.</p>

          <p>
          Future Suture is a mixed reality experience center that combines VR and 4D technologies to simulate climate conditions, environmental changes, and natural disasters. By using NASA data about the earth and its environment, we can create predictive models about how the future would look like based upon a given set of variables. Variety of actions would result in a variety of future possibilities. However, each city would have a different picture that can be painted. For example, Seattle can see the ice caps of Mt Rainier melt causing flash floods, or see the waterfront submerging a portion of downtown Seattle. These futures can be simulated in a VR+4D environment and can be experience in the form of a game that basically puts the onus of the future on the user’s actions.</p>

 <p>

     For this project, we created some predictive models to back our claim of the future and prototyped the gameplay in VR form. Our team won the Most Inspirational Hack award and also became one of two teams to make it to the Global round of the competition and got a chance to represent the city of Seattle in a global competition.

          <p>Climate Change is already having significant and harmful effects on our communities, our health, and our climate. Sea level rise is accelerating. The number of large wildfires is growing. Dangerous heat waves are becoming more common. Extreme storm events are increasing in many areas. More severe droughts are occurring in others.

We must take immediate action to address global warming or these consequences will continue to intensify, grow ever more costly, and increasingly affect the entire planet—including you, your community, and your family.

Global warming and climate change awareness is the first step towards the sustainable future. Our motivation is to make everyone think globally and act locally towards the sustainable future.

              If the future generation is made aware of the circumstances about the current situation, ‘Future Suture’ can trigger a chain reaction and alert everyone about the hazards of harmful human actions on environment.</p>

		   <h2 class="name-header">Goals</h2>
		  <p>Focus on Local Centers</p>

		 <p>The goal is to establish multiple ‘future suture’ experience centers across the globe.</p><p>Providing a future simulation of the region using machine learning.

Imagine you live in Seattle, you will be shown the future condition of Seattle based on the actions you perform in the game.Providing actionable measures to protect the environment catered to the specific region.
</p>


<p>For example, a person visiting the ‘Future Suture’ centre in Dubai might be encouraged to use solar energy as an alternative source of energy. A person visiting the ‘Future Suture’ centre in Seattle might be told to use ‘hydro-electric’ power as an alternative source of energy.</p>
		  
          <p><h2 class="name-header">How will it work</h2></p> 
		  
		   <p><h3>Climatic records and monitoring</h3></p>
Climatic variables such as temperature, pressure (surface), precipitation, water vapor (surface), surface wind speed, surface radiation budget are considered while collecting data.

<p><h3>Temperature forecast</h3></p>
The machine learning model forecasts temperature levels for us to model our VR system on. The pictures in the surrounding areas around the person will reflect the effects of these increasing temperature. These increases will not only be in terms of the heat or water levels but will also include the effects on the local flora and fauna.

          <p><h2 class="name-header">Impact</h2></p>
	
<p><h3>On local residents</h3>
Many people like Bob refute the effects of climate change because they cannot see them. They feel that climate chain is abstract and if at all true will not affect them directly. We want them to understand what effects adverse changes in global temperatures will have on their lives by showing them their surrounds post these changes. The residents of an area will be able to experience the future based on the predictions made on the available climate data and learn how to take the required steps to make informed decisions and the impact of their actions. The objective of our initiative is not just to spread awareness but also to teach people how to reduce their carbon footprint.

	<p><h3>On the government</h3></p>
The government will find a far more popular way than usual to reach as many people as possible and make a lasting impact at the younger generations by driving education through experiential learning. The app or game could be built inside a VR headset that can be distributed to schools and libraries for the general populace to use. The interactive game can make for a great learning solution for global warming in schools.
